"The capuchin monkey is the most common and the most intelligent of the New World monkeys.",
"To identify themselves more easily, squirrel monkeys will smear food on their tails, much like how humans may wear name tags.",
"As the smallest monkey in the world, its body is as small as 5 inches and tail is about 7. Also, it can fit in the palm of a human hand.",
"Mandrill monkeys have fangs that are longer than a lion's fangs. They also have multi-colored bottoms which makes them easier to see in the leafy gloom of the forest.",
"The fastest primate on Earth is the patas monkey. It can reach speeds of 34 miles per hour (55 km/h).",
"This is the only nocturnal monkey. They are also one of the few monkey species affected by malaria, and they have been used in non-human primate malaria experiments."];
