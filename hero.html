<p>
J. Cole is a famous American rapper/musical artist who has had a very sucessful career since his first mixtapes in the early
2000's. Although he was born in January 1985 at an American military base in Germany, Cole ended up being raised in 
Fayetteville, North Carolina by his single mother. Cole eventually grew his rap career to the sensation he is now,
owning his own record label, a grammy award and several platinum albums. Additionally, J. Cole is set to release a highly
anticipated album this year, called 'The Fall Off'.

I have selected J. Cole as a hero for two reasons. First of all, even with his hard upbringing, Cole still managed to
create an extremely successfull career. His father abandoned the family when he was very young, leaving his mother to
raise both him and his older brother by herself. Although money was tight, J. Cole worked extremely hard to make a
a name for himself. Doing very well in school and working odd jobs around Fayetteville, eventually building up enough
reputation to transition to a full time rap career. My second reason is that he makes good music, often keeping the
subject 'real' instead of what would usually be mainstream rap.
